If I, I get to know your name
Well I could trace your private number, baby
All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your lovin' arms
I want some, want some
I've set my sights on you
(And no one else will do)
And I, I've got to have my way now, baby
All I know is that to me
You look like you're havin' fun
Open up your lovin' arms
Watch out, here I come
You spin me right 'round, baby
Right 'round like a record, baby
Right 'round, 'round, 'round
You spin me right 'round, baby
Right 'round like a record, baby
Right 'round, 'round, 'round
â™ª
I, I got to be your friend now, baby
And I, I would like to move in just a little bit closer
All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your lovin' arms
Watch out, here I come
You spin me right 'round, baby
Right 'round like a record, baby
Right 'round, 'round, 'round
You spin me right 'round, baby
Right 'round like a record, baby
Right 'round, 'round, 'round
I want your love, love, love
I want your love, love, love
All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your lovin' arms
Watch out, here I come
